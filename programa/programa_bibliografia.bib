  abstractnote   = {Uses family as household and calculates its utility
                   function p173: altruistic means that an individual{'}s
                   utility function depends positively on the well being
                   of his/her spouse. altruism affects the individual{'}s
                   behavior. p179: since a selfish beneficiary wants to
                   maximise family income, she is led by the indivisible
                   hand of self interest to act as if she is altruistic
                   toward her benefactor. put it differently, the scarce
                   resource love is used economically because sufficient
                   caring by an altruist induces even a selfish
                   beneficiary to act as if she cares about her benefactor
                   as much as she cares about herself. although i have
                   elsewhere called this the rotten kid theorem, it
                   applies to the interaction between all types of
                   altruists and beneficiaries. p194: i believe that
                   altruism is less common in market transactions and more
                   common in families because altruism is less
                   {``}efficient{''} in the market place and more
                   {``}efficient{''} in families. p196: altruism is common
                   in families not only because families are small and
                   have many interactions, but also because marriage
                   markets tend to {``}assign{''} altruists to their
                   beneficiaries. p244: many historians have noted that
                   nuclear families are more affectionate and closer in
                   modern than in traditional societies, whereas cousins
                   and more distant kin are closer in traditional
                   societies. I argue here that modern spouses are closer
                   because love is more important in the selection of
                   mates, and that present day parents and children are
                   closer because quality rather than quantity of children
                   is emphasized. cousines and other kin are closer in
                   traditional societies, because kin groups insure and
                   train members and are more broadly responsible for
                   them... my analysis implies that individualism replaced
                   familialism because many family functions in
                   traditional societies are more effectively handled by
                   markets and other organizations of modern societies.},

abstract = { A model of endogenous growth is developed in which growth is driven by vertical innovations that involve creative destruction. Equilibrium is determined by a forward-looking difference equation, according to which the amount of research in any period depends negatively upon the amount expected next period. The paper analyzes positive and normative properties of stationary equilibria, and shows conditions for the existence of cyclical equilibria and no-growth traps. The growth rate may be more or less than optimal because a business-stealing effect counteracts the usual spillover and appropriability effects. In addition, innovations tend to be too small.

  Pages          = {-11},
  abstractnote   = {I present in this paper the skeleton of a theory of
                   marriage. The two basic assumptions are that each
                   person tries to do as well as possible and that the
                   "marriage market" is in equilibrium. With the aid of
                   several additional simplifying assumptions, I derive a
                   number of significant implications about behavior in
                   this market. For example, the gain to a man and woman
                   from marrying compared to remaining single is shown to
                   depend positively on their incomes, human capital, and
                   relative difference in wage rates. The theory also
                   implies that men differing in physical capital,
                   education or intelligence (aside from their effects on
                   wage rates), height, race, or many other traits will
                   tend to marry women with like values of these traits,
                   whereas the correlation between mates for wage rates or
                   for traits of men and women that are close substitutes
                   in household production will tend to be negative. The
                   theory does not take the division of output between
                   mates as given, but rather derives it from the nature
                   of the marriage market equilibrium. The division is
                   determined here, as in other markets, by marginal
                   productivities, and these are affected by the human and
                   physical capital of different persons, sex ratios (that
                   is, the relative numbers of men and women), and some
                   other variables.},

  abstract = {Advanced economies have experienced a tremendous increase in material
	well-being since the industrial revolution. Modern innovations such
	as personal computers, laser surgery, jet airplanes, and satellite
	communication have made us rich and transformed the way we live and
	work. But technological change has also brought with it a variety
	of social problems. It has been blamed at various times for increasing
	wage and income inequality, unemployment, obsolescence of physical
	and human capital, environmental deterioration, and prolonged recessions.
	To understand the contradictory effects of technological change on
	the economy, one must delve into structural details of the innovation
	process to analyze how laws, institutions, customs, and regulations
	affect peoples' incentive and ability to create new knowledge and
	profit from it. To show how this can be done, Philippe Aghion and
	Peter Howitt make use of Schumpeter's concept of creative destruction,

	growth rates are substantially independent from those that matter

	approaches to growth accounting (which considers changes in factor
	prices rather than quantities), spillover effects and increasing

	a number of types of intermediate products that have been invented

	kind of theory or no theory may not emphasize the lessons about technology
	that generalize. The complementarity between these fields is illustrated
	by an analysis of early industrialization. The key theoretical observation
	is that larger markets and larger stocks of resources create substantially
	bigger incentives for discovering new ways to use the resources.
	This simple insight helps explain why the techniques of mass production
	emerged in the United States during the first half of the 19th century.
	It also helps explain how a narrow advantage in the techniques of
	mass production for a small set of goods grew into broad position
	of industrial supremacy by the middle of the 20th century.},

They exploit data on personal income since 1840 and on gross state product since 1963. The U.S. states provide clear evidence of convergence, but the findings can be reconciled quantitatively with the neoclassical model only if diminishing returns to capital set in very slowly.
